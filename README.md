# Scheduling-System
This project implements a scheduling system in Prolog to assign slots to the available teaching assistants (TAs). 


The following should be noted:
-Each lab should be assigned exactly one TA.

-Each TA has a teaching load (the number of labs they are required to teach per
week).

-Each TA should not be assigned more labs than their teaching load (but can get
less load).

-The number of slots assigned to each TA per day must not exceed a particular
specified number.

**load is referred to with an 'L'**
